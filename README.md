# Car Advertisement Data Analysis

Project is rendered here: https://caradvertisementdataanalysis.onrender.com

This project takes a dataset of vehicles and does some exploratory data analysis on it. We see analyze a histogram of cars based on the car manufacturer and car type, and another of the car's model year and its condition. We also explore the inventory of cars and how long they have been listed based on the car condition and model year.

Users also have the option to compare car prices between two manufacturers, and between two car types that can be selected from the dropdown menu.
